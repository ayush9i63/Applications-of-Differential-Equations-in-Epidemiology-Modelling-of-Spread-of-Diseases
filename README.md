# README: Applications of Differential Equations in Epidemiology

## Overview

This repository contains a detailed presentation on the **Applications of Differential Equations in Epidemiology**. The focus of the presentation is on the **SIR model**, a fundamental tool used to understand and predict the dynamics of disease spread in populations. The SIR model categorizes the population into three compartments: Susceptible (S), Infected (I), and Recovered (R).

## Presentation Highlights

- **SIR Model Overview:** Learn about the structure and mathematical formulation of the SIR model, which is used to describe how diseases spread and impact populations.
  
- **Types of SIR Models:** Explore different variations of the SIR model, including the basic SIR model, SIR with vital dynamics, and the SIRS model, which accounts for individuals who lose immunity over time.

- **Vaccination Predictions:** Understand how differential equations can predict the number of people that need to be vaccinated to control an epidemic. This section includes practical examples and calculations based on the SIR model.

- **Disease Spread Modeling:** Discover how the SIR model is used to simulate and visualize the spread of infectious diseases. This part includes various scenarios and their implications for public health strategies.

## SIR Model Visualization

This diagram illustrates the flow between the compartments of the SIR model and how individuals transition from being susceptible to infected, and eventually to recovered.

## Usage

This presentation is ideal for those interested in epidemiological modeling, including students, researchers, and public health professionals. To use the contents of this presentation, simply review the slides and notes provided in this repository. The accompanying code and simulations can be used to replicate the results and gain a deeper understanding of the SIR model.
